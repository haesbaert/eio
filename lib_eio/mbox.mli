(** Synchronous domain-safe multi-reader, multi-writer message
   passing, aka rendezvous message passing.

   The mailbox {!Mbox.t} stores a value that can be retrieved by a
   reader via {!Mbox.recv} or pushed by a sender via
   {!Mbox.send}. Readers will block if no value is present and writers
   will block if a value is already present.

   Both sides synchronize via the same internal mutex. There is no thundering
   storm effect on blocked callers.

   Example:

   {[
     let mbox = Eio.Mbox.create () in
     Fiber.both
       (fun () -> Eio.Mbox.send mbox "hi")
       (fun () -> traceln "got: %s" (Eio.Mbox.recv mbox))
   ]}
 *)

type 'a t

val create : unit -> 'a t
(** [create ()] creates a new mailbox. *)

val send : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [send t m] sends message [m] to mailbox [t].

    If [t] already contains one message, [send] blocks until someone
    retrieves the message via [recv]. [send] is domain-safe and senders
    are blocked in a FIFO queue. *)

val recv : 'a t -> 'a
(** [recv t] retrieves message [m] from mailbox [t].

    If [t] is empty, [recv] blocks until someone calls [send] on
    it. [recv] is domain-safe and multiple readers are blocked in a
    FIFO queue. *)
